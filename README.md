##    Wire-frame
[my wire-frame](https://projects.invisionapp.com/freehand/document/S5mSo0MdL)
##    My story
-    As a user I want to access the tic-tac-toe games.
-    As a coder I want access to the files via github
-    As a user/coder viewing the file, I would want a clear cut understanding of the process in creating the game.
-    As a coder/employer I want a clear README doc, to:
    1.    explain the process of creating the game
    1.   List technologies used
    1.    List problems/tricky parts of the code
    1.    Link wire-frame and story
    1.    Explain any thing that the designer would improve in the future
-    As a user/coder/employer I want easy access to the site via git-hub.
-    As a user I want to see a modern page, that seamlessly transitions between pages(as a coder I know it's actually different views!)
-    As a user I want to play the game tic-tac-toe, having the tokens switch from x to o, without me having to do anything!
-   As I user I want an indication of win, loss or draw.
-   As a user I want to be able to sign up, log-in and change my password and logging out as needed & I want to know if I was successful in doing these actions.
##    Plan of attack
Follow the steps [listed](https://git.generalassemb.ly/ga-wdi-boston/game-project/blob/master/schedule.md)

If and only if I finish all of the above steps,
Additionally I would like to:
-   Create multi-player game from different devices
-   Add a table-side chat to game
-   Add AI element to game (one you can't beat!)
